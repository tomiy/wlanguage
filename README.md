# WLanguage for VSCode

This extension aims to provide language coloration and formatting for Windev's WLanguage.

It is mostly developped to work with French, as WLanguage is made to code in both English and French.

There is no guarantee that either syntax highlighting or formatting will keep up with more recent versions of Windev.

### Known problems

Formatter: non-complex case blocks fail to resolve their flags correctly
